    "In reality, solving PDEs is a complicated tasks. These equations normally depend on the geometry of the system, the source term and the different possible boundary conditions we impose. Problems like the impossibility to find analytical solutions make numerical methods an excellent tool to use for solving PDEs. In this document we are going to focus on the Finite Element Methods that allows to recast  PDEs into an algebraic expression by means of variational calculus  that guarantees the existence of a solution in the so called weak-form. Therefore, we end up with a well-posed PDE that satisfies the following conditions:\n",
